# BoofMap

**Find fire. Avoid boof.**

Mobile-first community cannabis quality & value reporting — plus meetup/seller experience reports.

## Tech stack

- Next.js App Router · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS
- **Progressive Web App** (installable, offline shell, service worker)
- **Convex** (database, realtime, server functions)
- **Clerk** (authentication, integrated with Convex JWT)
- **Cloudflare R2** (report images via presigned uploads)
- Leaflet + OpenStreetMap · Framer Motion

BoofMap is a **browser-based PWA** — not a native App Store / Play Store app. Users can add it to their home screen from Safari or Chrome.

## Setup

### 1. Convex

```bash
npm install
npx convex dev
```

Sign in when prompted. This creates your deployment and writes `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` to `.env.local`.

### 2. Cloudflare R2

1. Create an R2 bucket and enable public access (or custom domain).
2. Create API tokens with read/write on that bucket.
3. In the [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) → your project → **Settings → Environment variables**, add:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 API token access key |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 API token secret |
| `R2_BUCKET_NAME` | Bucket name |
| `R2_PUBLIC_URL` | Public base URL for objects (e.g. `https://pub-xxx.r2.dev`) |

### 3. Clerk + Convex auth

1. Create a [Clerk](https://clerk.com) application and add to `.env.local`:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   ```

2. In the Clerk Dashboard, **activate the Convex integration** and ensure the JWT template is named exactly `convex`.

3. Copy your Clerk **Frontend API URL** into `.env.local` and the Convex dashboard:

   ```
   CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://your-app.clerk.accounts.dev
   ```

4. Run `npx convex dev` so `convex/auth.config.ts` syncs to your deployment.

### 4. Admin access

After signing in once, copy your **Clerk user ID** from `/profile` and set:

```
ADMIN_USER_IDS=user_xxxxxxxx
```

Also add `ADMIN_USER_IDS` in the Convex dashboard (same value).

### 5. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs Next.js and Convex dev servers together.

### 6. Seed demo data (optional)

In the Convex dashboard, run the `seed:seedDemo` mutation once on an empty database.

## Local dev without Convex

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is unset, the app uses **local seed data** (no realtime, no uploads).

## Admin dashboard

Visit `/admin` when signed in with a Clerk user ID listed in `ADMIN_USER_IDS`.

## Legal tone

All copy uses community-report language. PII (phones, addresses, legal names, plates) is blocked in Convex mutations.
